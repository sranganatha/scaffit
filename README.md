**The open-source developer tool that adds modular scaffolds to your projects.**

## What is Scaffit?

**Scaffit** (pronounced "SCAFF-it") - "Scaffold" + "it" = "scaffold it for me"

Scaffit is a comprehensive developer platform that revolutionizes how you add features to your projects. More than just a CLI tool, Scaffit provides a complete ecosystem of battle-tested, production-ready scaffolds that you can add with a single command. It combines the power of a CLI, web dashboard, and extensive scaffold library to eliminate boilerplate setup forever.

## Why Use Scaffit?

### Save Time
Stop spending hours setting up authentication, payments, or analytics. Add complex features in minutes, not hours.

### Production Ready
Every scaffold follows industry best practices and security standards. No more "it works on my machine" - these are battle-tested patterns used by thousands of developers.

### Own Your Code
Generated code is fully yours - modify, extend, or remove as needed. No vendor lock-in, no hidden dependencies, no surprises.

### Modular by Design
Add only what you need. No bloated templates or unused code cluttering your project.

### Framework Agnostic
Works seamlessly with Next.js, React, Express, and more. One tool, multiple frameworks.

### Always Fresh
Scaffolds are maintained and updated with the latest best practices. Stay current without the hassle.
